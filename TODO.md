- create a `CONV -> CONV` onnx graph
   - execute it using onnxruntime, and verify that it produces the correct
     result
   - execute it on the simulator, and verify that it produces the correct result

- create a

```
CONV ---> CONV ---> CONV  ---> ADD
      |                    ^
      |                    |
      +--------------------+
```

onnx graph
   - execute it using onnxruntime
   - execute it on the simulator

# Steps
 âœ“ move weights into initializer for generated onnx models
 - add a check that we do not overwrite something before it is read, and a
   corresponding failing test case

# Issues
 - batching: CONV operator's first dimension is batch size
 - multiple input nodes (residuals)
